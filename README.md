# TheQGoogler
A simple (proof of concept) bot written in Node.js to automatically search the internet (Google and Bing) for Trivia answers from TheQ (https://www.theq.live/solutions/game-shows) in real-time

Packages: 
- eventsource
- axios
- puppeteer

How-To: Replace the token with your own token from the app, using some sort of sniffer. Use the command ```node app``` to run the bot when a game is on.
